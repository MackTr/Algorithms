# Algorithms
Creation of various data sorting algorithms

Huffman coding tree, 
this project contains 4 files : Huffman, List, priority queue and Jabberwock.txt, a text file.

Huffman is the main file that creates the huffman coding tree and that gives each character its code.
The list and priority queue file are used to analyse the text file, determine the first occurence and the weight of its character, then puts it in order.

Thank you for your time,

Have a nice day!
